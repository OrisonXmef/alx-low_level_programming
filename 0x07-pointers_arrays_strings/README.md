0x07-pointers_arrays_strings
This project is part of the curriculum for the "0x07-pointers_arrays_strings" course, and it focuses on learning and implementing concepts related to pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. Throughout this project, you will work on various tasks that require you to manipulate strings, use pointers to navigate and modify data, and understand the relationship between arrays and pointers.

Description
In this project, you will find a collection of C programs that cover the following key topics:

Pointers and Memory Addresses: Understand how pointers work, how to declare and initialize them, and how to use them to access and modify data stored in memory.

Arrays and Strings: Explore the relationship between arrays and pointers, work with character arrays (strings), and perform various string manipulations.

Pointer Arithmetic: Learn how to perform arithmetic operations on pointers, including pointer increment and decrement, pointer addition and subtraction, and array indexing.

Multi-dimensional Arrays: Work with multi-dimensional arrays, understanding how they are represented in memory, and how to access elements within them.

Project Structure
This project is organized into several directories, each containing C files related to specific topics and tasks. The directories and their contents include:

0x07-pointers_arrays_strings: Contains C files related to the main tasks and concepts covered in this project.
Usage
To compile and run the C programs in this project, you can use a C compiler like gcc. Simply navigate to the directory containing the C file you wish to compile and use the following command:

shell
Copy code
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic [C_FILE] -o [OUTPUT_EXECUTABLE]
Replace [C_FILE] with the name of the C file you want to compile and [OUTPUT_EXECUTABLE] with the desired name for the compiled executable.
